# Real-World Cryptography Exercises

Welcome to my collection of exercises designed to demonstrate attacks on real-world cryptographic systems. This is an implementation of the exercises that have been designed by the Cryptopals authors :

## Overview

This project offers a hands-on approach to learning about cryptography by solving practical problems. Unlike traditional learning methods like taking classes or reading books, these exercises are derived from:

- **Weaknesses in real-world systems**
- **Modern cryptographic constructions**

Through these exercises, I aim to:

1. Explore the vulnerabilities of real-world cryptosystems.
2. Learn key cryptographic concepts independently.
3. Gain a deeper understanding of how cryptosystems are both built and attacked.

By the end of this project, I plan to not only expand my knowledge of cryptography but also develop an intuition for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems.

## Why This Approach?

Traditional learning often focuses on theory, while this project emphasizes:

- **Practical applications**: Solving real-world problems with cryptographic relevance.
- **Independent learning**: Providing just enough guidance to explore and understand the concepts.
- **Understanding attacks**: Demonstrating how cryptosystems can fail, helping me think like an attacker to better defend against vulnerabilities.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Study Problem Statements**:

   - Review the provided problem statements.
   - Research and study the underlying cryptographic principles.

2. **Solve Exercises**:

   - Implement solutions for each exercise, focusing on:
     - Symmetric cryptography
     - Public-key cryptography
     - Hash functions
     - Random number generation vulnerabilities
   - Test implementations using the solution verification tools provided.

3. **Document Progress**:

   - Maintain a log of completed exercises and key learnings.
   - Share findings and insights on implementation challenges.

4. **Review and Reflect**:

- Analyze how the cryptographic concepts apply to real-world systems.
- Reflect on the methods used to exploit vulnerabilities and propose defenses.

## Exercises

https://cryptopals.com/
Each exercise is designed to teach specific cryptographic principles. I will document my progress and learnings in a structured format, ensuring a clear understanding of:

- How each cryptographic concept works.
- Common vulnerabilities and their implications.
- Potential real-world impact of the attack demonstrated.

## Contributing to the Project

I plan to contribute back to this project by:

1. Adding improvements to existing exercises.
2. Proposing and implementing new exercises.
3. Submitting pull requests with clear descriptions of updates or enhancements.

## Feedback and Collaboration

I welcome feedback on my implementations and insights! If you have suggestions or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out or open an issue in the repository.
