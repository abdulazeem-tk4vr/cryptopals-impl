# Rust Practice Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Rust exercises that I am working on to practice Rust, keep my skills up to date, and improve my proficiency with the language. The code here is intended for production optimized use, but please use it rather as a personal learning resource.

Feel free to browse, learn, and suggest improvements!
